                Portland, Oregon born and raised. The playground is where
                I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all
                cool and shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. <br>
                That's when a couple of guys, who were up to no good, started making
                trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got
                scared and she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
