        <p>
            Portland, Oregon born and raised. The playground is where
            I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all
            cool and shootin' some b-ball outside of the school. <br>
            That's when a couple of guys, who were up to no good, started making
            trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got
            scared and she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
